A chat application built with Angular 6 + NodeJS.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è This application is a work in progress, not everything is working as intended ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

## General information
This application is divided into 2 categories, client code (Angular) and server code (NodeJS). To run the project, both applications must be running at the same time.

## Pre-requisites

## Usage

To build and run the projects, make sure that NodeJS is installed and download dependencies for each project (client/server) by issuing:

```bash
cd client/
npm install
cd ../server/
npm install
```

And then, open 2 different terminal windows/tabs and run:

```bash
# First window/tab
cd client && npm run start

# Second window/tab
cd server && npm run start
```
